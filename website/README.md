# Running Vite Dev Server

Okay so there's some issue with using the proxy config to make the routes simpler...

So to access pages you have to put in their full path for example:
To load the login page on localhost:4001 you have to address:

localhost:4001/website/landingPage/landing.html

login
localhost:4001/website/loginPage/login.html
